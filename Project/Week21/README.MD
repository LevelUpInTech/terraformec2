Your team needs you to create a custom module for ec2 instance with a amazon linux 2 ami ID

1. Fork and clone this repo locally with the ec2.tf template as a starting point to create the ec2 : https://github.com/LevelUpInTech/terraformec2.git

2. Create a custom module for ec2 out of the resource block that you can use as repeatable infrastructure

3. Push the new created module and the ec2.tf file to your repo!


Good Luck
